# Implementing binary decision trees

This is a [programming assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification/supplement/seWHJ/implementing-binary-decision-trees) for the Coursera open course  [*machine learning classification*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-classification/home/welcome) from University of Washington. 

In this project, a basic recursive building algorithm is implemented for a binary decision tree.  A training set on risky loans identification is used to train the decision tree. After that, the decision tree's performance is verified on a separate test set.

In my implementation, Python packages *numpy* and *pandas* are adopted.
